## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```txt
"mariadbent": [
  {
    "credentials": {
      "host": "galera-service.service.consul",
      "hostname": "galera-service.service.consul",

<p class="note">
Please be aware that the number of concurrent connections (max_connections) to MariaDB is limited. You can manage this by using connection pooling.

## <a id='administrating'></a> Administrating Your MariaDB Instances

To connect to a running MariaDB instance with your local development tools, you can use the [`cf ssh`](../devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html) feature of the cf CLI.

You can deploy [PivotalMySQLWeb](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/PivotalMySQLWeb) for MariaDB management on the Swisscom Application Cloud. It's not the most feature rich GUI client for MariaDB, but a nice cloud native app with a simple deployment process.

You can use the [cf-mysql-plugin](https://github.com/andreasf/cf-mysql-plugin) for the [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli). This plugin installs the `mysql`and `mysqldump` clients and integrates them into the Cloud Foundry ecosystem.

## <a id='usecases'></a> Use Cases

A typical use case for MariaDB is a Cloud Foundry hosted web app which needs a relational data store.

Our setup is not suitable for expensive analytics or "Big Data" processing.

## <a id='sample-application'></a> Sample Application

Cloud Foundry: [Spring Music Example](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music)

## <a id='limitations'></a> Known Limitations

Our HA MariaDB offering is based on Galera, which brings some [known limitations (from mariadb.com)](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/mariadb-galera-cluster-known-limitations/) with it. Please read this article carefully.

A summary of Galera limitations is on [Tips on Converting to Galera](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/tips-on-converting-to-galera/) (blockquote modified for our offering):

> Schema Design:

> - InnoDB storage engine only, every table must have a Primary Key. The legacy storage engine MyISAM is disabled with `enforce_storage_engine=InnoDB` in our offering.
> - Please use indexes according to your query pattern.

> Application Development:

> - Check for errors, even after `COMMIT`.
> - Moderate sized transactions.
> - Don't make assumptions about `AUTO_INCREMENT` values other than uniqueness. Not monotonicity, not gapless. (This applies for non-Galera, but probably happens more often here.)

> Administration and Schema Migrations:

> - `ALTER`s are handled differently. See [SCHEMA UPGRADES](http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/schemaupgrades.html) for more details. Please be careful and test schema migrations.
> - `TRIGGER`s and `EVENT`s may need checking. By default, with row-based replication, triggers run on the master, and the effects of their executions are replicated to the slaves.

Please add a **primary key** to every table you create. This is because of *Row Based Replication*. Tables without primary key may cause a downtime of the Galera Cluster (depending on the number of records).

Please contact Swisscom Application Cloud support when you need to issue **long running DDL changes** (for example `ALTER TABLE` with thousends of records). Long running DDL causes an outage for all customers on the cluster.

Our Galera aaS is a **shared cluster**. Each customer has their own database. Put simply, the service broker executes the following statements:

```sql
CREATE DATABSE CF_DATABASE_NAME
GRANT ALL ON `CF_DATABASE_NAME`.* TO 'USER'@'SUBNET'
REVOKE LOCK TABLES ON `CF_DATABASE_NAME`.* FROM 'USER'@'SUBNET'
```

## <a id='migrations'></a> Minimize Downtime for Schema Migrations

Lots of customers complained that when doing an `ALTER TABLE` statement in Galera, the whole cluster is read-locked for the duration of the statement. On big tables (millions of records) this can result in many hours of "outage". Here are some tips to minimize that behavior.

- Add `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE` for Online DDL Operations in your `ALTER TABLE` statements. For example, to add a new index, write `ALTER TABLE test ADD INDEX idx_test (test), ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE`. Be warned Online DDL is not always online and may incur locks.
- `ALGORITHM=INPLACE, LOCK=NONE` has some limitations and not supported operations. If you it doesn't work for your case, use [pt-online-schema-change](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html). The tool `pt-online-schema-change` alters a tableâ€™s structure without blocking reads or writes. Please do not use this tool before reading its linked documentation and checking your [service backups](../devguide-sc/services/backups.html) carefully. In our current offering you don't have the necessary permissions for `pt-online-schema-change`. Please ask our support to `GRANT PROCESS, REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO` for your `serice-key`. We can't grant that on shared cluster, it means you must have your own dedicated Galera/MariaDB cluster.
- Don't use `TRUNCATE` with huge tables. Please `DROP` the table and recreate.


## <a id='framework'></a> Database Frameworks Integration tips
- Liquibase is not fully Galera compatible. See bug report [primary key on DATABASECHANGELOG, PK_DATABASECHANGELOG, is no longer created](https://liquibase.jira.com/plugins/servlet/mobile#issue/CORE-1909) for solutions.

## <a id='definer'></a> Definer and bind-service (Change Credentials)

With `cf bind-service` the service broker (Cloud Foundry component) creates new credentials for security reasons (`cf env APP_NAME` to view them). This will break existing routines, triggers, views and events because they are still using the old user.

Error code from MariaDB backend:

```txt
Error: 1449 SQLSTATE: HY000 (ER_NO_SUCH_USER)
Message: The user specified as a definer ('%s'@'%s') does not exist
```

See the MariaDB blog post [Changing the DEFINER of MySQL stored routines etc.](https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/changing-definer-mysql-stored-routines-etc) for ideas on how to fix this.

## <a id='migration'></a> Migrate your service instance

See [Migrate from legacy MariaDB to MariaDB Ent](./migrate-mariadb-to-mariadbent.html) how to migrate your service instance to a new database cluster.


## <a id='backup'></a> Backup
Within your MariaDB service instance, you can start a backup and also restore it afterwards.
For more information about this feature, check the [service backup guide](../devguide-sc/services/backups.html).

If you need more fine-grained control over your backups there is also an app available that allows for automatic scheduled backups: [backman - the appcloud backup manager](https://github.com/swisscom/backman).
Any MariaDB service instance bound to this app will be automatically backed up, can be downloaded and also restored on-demand.

If you accidentally `DROP` a table or other error happens, we can not restore your table unfortunately. Please make sure you create a [service backup](../devguide-sc/services/backups.html) in the Portal, via the [CLI with the Swisscom Plugin](https://github.com/swisscom/appcloud-cf-cli-plugin) or with [backman](https://github.com/swisscom/backman) before you do changes.


## <a id='more'></a> More info from upstream open source project

Our MariaDB Enterprise offering is based on the the open source [Cloud Foundry MySQL Service](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release).

## <a id='more'></a> Compatibility to MySQL

Please be aware that MariaDB and MySQL are not fully compatible and have a few different features for developers (and administrators).

We deploy MariaDB 10.1.x series.

See [MariaDB versus MySQL - Compatibility](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/server-client-software/mariadb-releases/compatibility-differences/mariadb-vs-mysql-compatibility/) and [MariaDB versus MySQL - Features](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/server-client-software/mariadb-releases/compatibility-differences/mariadb-vs-mysql-features/) for furhter infos.
