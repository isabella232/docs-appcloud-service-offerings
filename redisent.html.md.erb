## <a id='integrating-your-service'></a> Integrating the Service With Your App

After the [creation](../devguide/services/managing-services.html#create) of the service and the [binding](../devguide/services/application-binding.html#bind) of the service to the application, the environment variable [VCAP_SERVICES](../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES) is created. Information about the credentials are stored in this variable as shown here:

```json

You can connect to your service by discovering the current master via one of the "`sentinels`". Be sure to use one of the [supported client libraries](http://redis.io/clients) with the sentinel feature. See the [Redis Enterprise sample app](https://github.com/swisscom/cf-redis-example-app/tree/redisent).

For administrative work, you can connect directly via the `"host"` and `"port"`, which always points to the currently elected master. Please note that this connection variant should not be used for your production applications, always use sentinel-based discovery when possible.

## <a id='administrative'></a> Administrating your Redis instances

To connect to a running Redis instance with your local development tools, you can use the [`cf ssh`](../devguide/deploy-apps/ssh-services.html) feature of the cf CLI.
